[{"categories":["collaborate"],"contents":"Running effective meetings is essential for modern businesses - and it\u0026rsquo;s especially hard to run effective remote meetings. A remote meeting guideline provides guidance on how to succeed here.\nWhat is it? A remote meeting guideline is a collection of rules and best practices on how to run effective remote meetings.\nWhy use it? Without a remote meeting guideline those meetings will more or less be held like meetings in presence. But this leads to inefficiency as successful remote meetings require more facilitation, more discipline, and should not last too long as remote meetings are more exhausting than meetings in presence.\nHow to do it? A sample remote meeting guideline General rules  Remote meetings are more exhausting than meetings in presence. No meeting should takes more than 2 hours and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t spend more than 4 hours in remote meetings per day. Remote meetings require more discipline and thus also a strong leadership of a meeting. Each remote meeting must have an pre-assigned host. Please refer to general meeting hosting and facilitation best practices.  Meeting preparation As a participant:\n Take care of an appropriate infrastructure and the required technical setup  Internet access: prefer LAN/PowerLAN connection over WiFi Camera: Notebook cameras are OK, HD USB cameras are way better Audio: The notebook audio setup is mostly not sufficient for video conferences. Use headsets or speakerphones and activate noise and echo reduction.   Take care of having enough to drink for the meeting (e.g. a 1l bottle of water) Form the new habit to join the meeting 2 minutes in advance.  Running the Meeting  always switch on the video. Facial expression and body language are an important part of communication. Only switch the video off if you\u0026rsquo;ve troubles with the internet connection or if you participate in a large meeting where you have no active parts. keep the focus on the meeting  do not work on other tasks in parallel (not even on e-mails and chats) do not use your smartphone do not change the virtual background during the meeting    Further information Further reading  Art of Hosting How to facilitate a workshop Meeting roles  Related items  Video Conferencing Online Retros ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/meeting-guideline/","tags":["practice","culture"],"title":"Remote Meeting Guideline"},{"categories":["collaborate","learn","socialize"],"contents":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.\n","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/video-conferencing/","tags":["tool"],"title":"Video Conferencing"},{"categories":["collaborate","learn","socialize"],"contents":"You know pair programming? Mob programming is similar to pair programming with the whole team.\nWhat is Mob Programming? Mob programming is a practise where your complete team comes together to implement a small user story or feature.\nWhy do Mob Programming? Mob Programming helps you to share information about how a problem was solved your source code or how a specific part of the implementation is realized with the whole team. It is also an option to easily onboard new team members or discuss working methods with the help of a concrete example.\nHow to do Mob Programming? Like Pair Programming, Mob Programming also has the roles of driver and navigator. The driver sits at the keyboard, writes the program code and shares the screen for all others (e.g. with video conferencing tool). All other team members watch the shared source code and collaborate on solving the problem. One of the team members has the role of the navigator (this role rotates) and tells the driver what to do.\nTips  All team members turn on their video and audio. To keep all participants concentrated and active, the rotation frequency must be high (every 2-3 minutes) and the team must not be too large. If there are five or more participants, you are usually already too often inactive. The concept of mob programming can also be used to write documentation or tests.

Digital whiteboards help to transfer this collaborative experience into the digital world.\nWhat is it? Whiteboards only work when the team is in the same space. As work becomes more remote, whiteboards are replaced by their digital equivalent. Digital whiteboards help to transfer the collaborative experience of whiteboards into the digital world. Digital whiteboards are essential in a remote-only setting but also very helpful in hybrid scenarios with distributed teams in different offices, or when some participants are joining from home.\nWhy use it? To enable realtime remote collaboration on whiteboards especially for creative team processes and to stimulate team flow.\nHow to do it? The following picture shows a sample digital whiteboard used for brainstorming based on the tool miro. Here is our how-to for the different stages of a digital whiteboard session:\n\u0026hellip; prepare a whiteboard session Prepare the session right on the canvas. Try to reflect the meeting agenda directly on the whiteboard: Add the agenda to the whiteboard and prepare regions for every agenda item. Visually link the regions according the storyline of the meeting.\nIf the agenda item is a presentation: Include the slides on the whiteboard.\nIf the agenda item is interactive: Choose an appropriate template that facilitates the required group process the most. Good digital whiteboard solutions provide templates for a lot of creative methodologies (like those listed at servicedesigntools.org or Open Practice Library).\nIf the agenda item can be prepared by the team upfront: Provide the whiteboard upfront and define regions where the participants can insert their content upfront.\nFinally: Lock all parts of the whiteboard which shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be modified during the meeting.\n\u0026hellip; run a whiteboard session Each whiteboard session needs a facilitator who guides the group through the agenda and the corresponding whiteboard. There are basically three different interaction modes during a digital whiteboard session:\n Brainstorming mode, where all participants first insert their ideas, then the ideas are presented and clustered and finally conclusions are derived. Co-edition mode, where a small group of participants (3-5) are editing the same region of the whiteboard simultaneously and all modifications are merged in realtime. Presentation mode, where one participant presents a region of the whiteboard or draws \u0026amp; explains in realtime.  Meeting minutes can be written directly to the whiteboard or on a separate document which is linked to the whiteboard.\n\u0026hellip; follow-up a whiteboard session After a whiteboard session its good practice to send all participants and maybe some other effected stakeholders a link to the final whiteboard and lock all items on the whiteboard for edits before.\nFurther information Available tools  G2: List of Collaborative Whiteboard Software Digital whiteboards in video conferencing solutions like Zoom, Webex, Teams The leading digital whiteboards: miro and Mural A digital collaboration space for Office 365: Deon Some hardware devices for digital whiteboards: Google Jambaord, Microsoft SurfaceHub,  Related items  Video Conferencing Online Retros ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/tools-digital-whiteboard/","tags":["tool"],"title":"Digital Whiteboard"},{"categories":["collaborate","learn"],"contents":"A Retrospective is an opportunity for the Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted.\nWhat is it? According to the Agile Alliance a (heartbeat) retrospective is: The team meets regularly, usually adhering to the rhythm of its iterations, to explicitly reflect on the most significant events to have occurred since the previous such meeting, and take decisions aiming at remediation or improvement.\nA Online Retrospective runs a retrospective online with the help of web-based tools.\nWhy use it? According to the Agile Alliance the benefits of a (heartbeat) retrospective are:\n retrospectives leverage the benefits of iterative development: they offer explicit opportunities to improve the teamâ€™s performance over the duration of the project retrospectives promote ownership and responsibility by the project team with respect to all aspects of the process; participants can understand the rationale behind all process decisions  A Online Retrospective transfers these benefits into a remote setting where all or most of the retro participants are distributed.\nHow to do it? First you\u0026rsquo;ve to choose the structure of the retrospective. Retromat and FunRetrospective are great resources to find effective and fun structures which are mostly defined by the questions they ask. The default questions are: What was good? What to improve?\nA special form of a retrospective are team health checks like those used by Spotify. Good online retro tools also support team health checks.\nAfter the structure is clear and the retro tool is prepared accordingly the retro can be run in several rounds:\nFirst round: Each participant enters the input to the retrospective structure. The team decides wether the input is visible immediately or after the first round is closed.\nSecond round: Each participant presents his/her input and all participants can ask questions of understanding. No discussions!\nThird round: The input is prioritized, clustered and action items are derived.\nAfter the retrospective the result is provided to all participants and to other stakeholders. It is good practice to provide feedback to the top lessons learned to the whole organization (e.g. in a Slack channel #lessionslearned) and to use an issue tracking system like JIRA, Trello or Meistertask to track the derived action items.\nFurther information Available tools  TeamRetro Retrium FunRetro Parabol  Retrospective structures  Retromat FunRetrospective Squad Health Checks  Related items  Video Conferencing Online Retros ","permalink":"https://www.remoteworklibrary.io/posts/tools-online-retros/","tags":["tool","practice","culture"],"title":"Online Retrospective"}]
